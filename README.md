# ff14-waymarks

Small repo to backup FF14 waymarks taken from [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/Em-Six/FFXIVWaymarkPresets/wiki), as well as modified ones I did myself.

Meant to be used with the [WaymarkPresetPlugin](https://github.com/PunishedPineapple/WaymarkPresetPlugin) for [XIVLauncher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher).

Also added the VBS script I use for staying idle.
